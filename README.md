# BiteBase
A Recipe web application built using the Django web framework

## Objective
In this project, I used the Django web framework to develop a fully-functional recipe application which can create, read, modify and save recipes, as well as search for recipes by their ingredients.

The web application includes an admin panel for data handling and visualization.

The creation of BiteBase demonstrates my development skills and understanding of the fundamentals of the Django web framework.

## Key Features
- Allows for user authentication, login, and logout.
- Users can search for recipes by their ingredients.
- Automatically rates each recipe by difficulty level.
- Receives user input and handles errors appropriately.
- Displays more details on each recipe if the user asks for them.
- Adds user recipes to an SQLite database.
- Includes a Django Admin dashboard for working with database entries.
- Shows statistics and visualizations based on trends and data analysis.

## Technical Requirements
- Works on Python 3.6+ installations and Django version 3.
- Handles exceptions or errors that arise during user input, for example, then displays user-friendly error messages.
- Connects to a PostgreSQL database hosted locally on the same system (an SQLite database is used during development).
- Provides an easy-to-use interface, supported by simple forms of input and concise, easy-to-follow instructions.
